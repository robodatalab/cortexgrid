GitOps manifests watched by Argo CD. See [argo-deployments/](argo-deployments/) for the actual deployment specs. [argocd.yaml](argocd.yaml) is the one-shot bootstrap applied at seed time and is not watched by Argo.

## FAQ

### Argo sync is stuck / app stays OutOfSync after a Git push

The operation hit its retry limit, or Argo cached a stale state. Clear it:

```bash
kubectl -n argocd patch app <app-name> --type merge -p '{"operation": null}'
kubectl -n argocd annotate app <app-name> argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
```

### How do I verify Argo is actually looking at my latest commit?

```bash
kubectl -n argocd get app <app-name> -o jsonpath='{.status.sync.revision}'
git show <that-sha>:<path-to-file>
```

If the SHA is stale, force a hard refresh as above.

### A sync fails because a CRD isn't installed yet

Argo validates all resources upfront; a resource whose CRD comes from a sibling Application will fail validation before sync-waves take effect. Annotate the CRD-dependent resource:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
```
